 * [Meta-analysis Fixed effects vs. random effects](http://www.meta-analysis.com/downloads/Meta-analysis%20fixed%20effect%20vs%20random%20effects.pdf)  
  __Of great importance__ in working with these data __is__ the realization __that__ different experiments typically have been designed to address different questions.  
  In general; Generally  
  __A lion's share__ of something: a large part, or most, of something  
  The inverse variance is determined primarily by the sample size, but it is a more __nuanced__ measure.  
  However, this assumption may be __implausible__ in many systematic reviews.  
  When we decided to incorporate a group of studies in a meta-analysis we assume that the studies have enough in common that it makes sense to __synthesize the information__.  
  In this __schematic__ the observed effect is determined by the true effect __plus__ the within-study error.  
  This __logic__ is __ope rationalized__ in a series of formulas.  
  By applying this scaling factor we ensure that Tau-squared is __in the same metric__ as the variance within-studies.

 A beta is __derived__ from sequential cleavage of APP by beta and gamma secretase.  
 Initiating the A-beta processing system as well as showing an increased level in patients, BACE1 __plays a central role__ in AD pathogenesis.

 The APOE-epsilon4 carriers were __over-represented__ in Braak V-VI group.  
 Increased MS4A6A expression in our neuropathologic cohort is __in line with__ previous findings, which have reported higher plasma levels of MS4A6A in AD patients than in controls or subjects with mild cognitive impairments.  

* [immune and alzheimer](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/344/6183/519.long)  
 We __note__ an __over-representation of__ T cell-specific eQTLs among susceptibility alleles for autoimmune diseases and __of__ monocyte-specific eQTLs among Alzheimer's and Parkinson's desease variants.   
 This polarization __implicates specific immune cell types in__ these diseases and __points to__ the need to identify the __cell-autonomous effects__ of disease susceptibility variants.   
 Because most disease-associated variants localize to noncoding regions of the genome, __an initial role__ of their function can be __inferred__ from their __proximity to a gene__ and association to gene expression levels or to epigenomic features derived from representative tissues and cell types.  
 __Given the centrol role of__ inflammation in many diseases, we __laveraged__ differences in the genetic structure of human populations to __systematically interogate__ the role of peripherial blood cell types that __represent__ the lymphoid(CD4 plus T lymphocyte) and myeloid(CD14 plus CD16 minus monocyte) __arms__ of the immune system.  
 The low median Vst estimates __suggest__ __minimal gene expression variance__ between populations.  
 The putative role of inflammation has __previously been invoked__ in
  aing-related neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and PD, but our
  result bring a genetic __underpinning__ and candidate pathways to  these observations.  
  We provide support for a role of myeloid cells in the __prodromal phase__ of neurodegenerative disease.
  Both of these cell types __share many of the__ transcriptome patterns of
  monocytes.  
  __Despite__ its inherent logistic challenges, the profiling of
  purified primary cells from multiple human populations __was__ clearly
  __beneficial in__ several respect, including the __reduction__ of
  the __credible__ set of variants associated with a given trait.  
  Though the majority of eQTLs are shared, the ImmVar study __provides
  clear examples__ of __context specificity__ of eQTLs and has __yeild
  insights into__ the relative __role__ of two representative cell types __in
  exerting__ the functional consequences of disease-associated
  variants.  
  Further, the __depletion__ of disease-associated eQTLs with effects
  in both cell-types is __intriguing__ and suggests that the
  __evolutionary history__ of cell-specific and __pleiotropic__
  variants is an important area of future investigation.
  __Overall__, this __component__ of the ImmVar Project __represents a
  strong foundation__ for future explorations of the role of disease
  susceptibility variants in an __increadingly diverse matrix__ of cell
  types, stimuli, and in vivo context.

* [mendelian disease complex disease comorbidity](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867413010246)  
  We __conjectured__ that the significant complex-Mendelian
  comorbidities displayed in Figure2 indicate that the genes and
  pathways perturbed in the Mendelian disorders also play a role in
  the __etiology__  of the corresponding complex diseases.  
  We hypothesized that the "Mendelian code" could be used to
  __pinpoint__ loci that harbor complex disease-predisposing genetic
  variants.  
  we __probed__ __legacy__ genoe-wide association results and
  __asked__ whether common variants associated with complex diseases
  were enriched within the loci implicated by the Mendelian
  comorbidities.  
  Overall, these results suggest that the loci implicated by the
  Mendelian code are likely to contain __a spectrum of__ complex
  disease predisposing variants, providing testable hypotheses for
  future gene resequencing and exome analyses.
