  __Of great importance__ in working with these data __is__ the realization __that__ differenct experiments typically have been designed to address different questions.  
  In general; Generally  
  __A lion's share__ of something: a large part, or most, of something  
  The inverse variance is determinied primarily by the sample size, but it is a more __nuanced__ measure.  
  However, this assumption may be __implausible__ in many systemiatic reviews.  
  When we decided to incorporate a group of studies in a meta-analysis we assume that the studies have enough in common that it makes sense to __synthesize the information__.  
  In this __schematic__ the observed effect is determined by the true effect __plus__ the within-study error.  
  This __logic__ is __operationalized__ in a series of formulas.  
  By applying this scaling factor we ensure that Tau-squared is __in the same metric__ as the variance within-studies.

 A beta is __derived__ from sequential cleavage of APP by beta and gamma secretase.  
 Initiating the A-beta processing system as well as showing an inceased level in patients, BACE1 __plays a central role__ in AD pathogenesis.

 The APOE-epsilon4 carriers were __overrepresented__ in Braak V-VI group.  
 Increased MS4A6A expression in our neuropathologic cohort is __in line with__ revious findings, which have reported higher plasma levels of MS4A6A in AD patients than in controls or subjects with mild cognitive impairments.__
