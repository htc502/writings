 * [Meta-analysis Fixed effects vs. random effects](http://www.meta-analysis.com/downloads/Meta-analysis%20fixed%20effect%20vs%20random%20effects.pdf)  
  __Of great importance__ in working with these data __is__ the realization __that__ different experiments typically have been designed to address different questions.  
  In general; Generally  
  __A lion's share__ of something: a large part, or most, of something  
  The inverse variance is determined primarily by the sample size, but it is a more __nuanced__ measure.  
  However, this assumption may be __implausible__ in many systematic reviews.  
  When we decided to incorporate a group of studies in a meta-analysis we assume that the studies have enough in common that it makes sense to __synthesize the information__.  
  In this __schematic__ the observed effect is determined by the true effect __plus__ the within-study error.  
  This __logic__ is __ope rationalized__ in a series of formulas.  
  By applying this scaling factor we ensure that Tau-squared is __in the same metric__ as the variance within-studies.

* [immune and alzheimer](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/344/6183/519.long)  
  We __note__ an __over-representation of__ T cell-specific eQTLs among susceptibility alleles for autoimmune diseases and __of__ monocyte-specific eQTLs among Alzheimer's and Parkinson's desease variants.   
  This polarization __implicates specific immune cell types in__ these diseases and __points to__ the need to identify the __cell-autonomous effects__ of disease susceptibility variants.   
  Because most disease-associated variants localize to noncoding regions of the genome, __an initial role__ of their function can be __inferred__ from their __proximity to a gene__ and association to gene expression levels or to epigenomic features derived from representative tissues and cell types.  
 __Given the centrol role of__ inflammation in many diseases, we __laveraged__ differences in the genetic structure of human populations to __systematically interogate__ the role of peripherial blood cell types that __represent__ the lymphoid(CD4 plus T lymphocyte) and myeloid(CD14 plus CD16 minus monocyte) __arms__ of the immune system.  
 The low median Vst estimates __suggest__ __minimal gene expression variance__ between populations.  
 The putative role of inflammation has __previously been invoked__ in aing-related neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and PD, but our result bring a genetic __underpinning__ and candidate pathways to  these observations.  
  We provide support for a role of myeloid cells in the __prodromal phase__ of neurodegenerative disease.
  Both of these cell types __share many of the__ transcriptome patterns of monocytes.  
  __Despite__ its inherent logistic challenges, the profiling of purified primary cells from multiple human populations __was__ clearly  __beneficial in__ several respect, including the __reduction__ of the __credible__ set of variants associated with a given trait.  
  Though the majority of eQTLs are shared, the ImmVar study __provides clear examples__ of __context specificity__ of eQTLs and has __yeild insights into__ the relative __role__ of two representative cell types __in exerting__ the functional consequences of disease-associated variants.  
  Further, the __depletion__ of disease-associated eQTLs with effects in both cell-types is __intriguing__ and suggests that the __evolutionary history__ of cell-specific and __pleiotropic__ variants is an important area of future investigation.
  __Overall__, this __component__ of the ImmVar Project __represents a strong foundation__ for future explorations of the role of disease susceptibility variants in an __increadingly diverse matrix__ of cell types, stimuli, and in vivo context.

  We __conjectured__ that the significant complex-Mendelian comorbidities displayed in Figure2 indicate that the genes and pathways perturbed in the Mendelian disorders also play a role in the __etiology__  of the corresponding complex diseases.  
  We hypothesized that the "Mendelian code" could be used to __pinpoint__ loci that harbor complex disease-predisposing genetic variants.  
  we __probed__ __legacy__ genoe-wide association results and __asked__ whether common variants associated with complex diseases were enriched within the loci implicated by the Mendelian comorbidities.  
  Overall, these results suggest that the loci implicated by the Mendelian code are likely to contain __a spectrum of__ complex disease predisposing variants, providing testable hypotheses for future gene resequencing and exome analyses.

  We __demonstrate__ the successful application of exome sequencing to discover a gene for autosomal dominant disorder, Kabuki syndrome.  
  The exomes of ten unrelated __probands__ __were subjected to__ massively parallel sequencing.  
  There was no __compelling__ gene containing novel variants in all affected individuals.  
  __Less stringent filtering criteria permitted modest__ genetic heterogeneity or missing mata, __but identified__ multiple candidate genes.  
  __As previously__, our analyses focused primarily on nonsynonymous(NS) variants, splice acceptor and donor site mutations(SS) and coding indels(I), __anticipating__ that synonymous variants were far less likely to be pathogenic.
  We also __predicted__ that variants __underlying__ Kabuki syndrome are rare, and __therefore__ likely to be novel.  
  We alse developed a __post hoc__ ranking of candidate genes based onfunctional impact of vairants present.  
  __Ultimately__, loss-of-function mutations in MLL2 were identified in nine out of ten cases in the discovery __cohort__.
