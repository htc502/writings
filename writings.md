  __Of great importance__ in working with these data __is__ the realization __that__ different experiments typically have been designed to address different questions.  
  In general; Generally  
  __A lion's share__ of something: a large part, or most, of something  
  The inverse variance is determined primarily by the sample size, but it is a more __nuanced__ measure.  
  However, this assumption may be __implausible__ in many systematic reviews.  
  When we decided to incorporate a group of studies in a meta-analysis we assume that the studies have enough in common that it makes sense to __synthesize the information__.  
  In this __schematic__ the observed effect is determined by the true effect __plus__ the within-study error.  
  This __logic__ is __ope rationalized__ in a series of formulas.  
  By applying this scaling factor we ensure that Tau-squared is __in the same metric__ as the variance within-studies.

 A beta is __derived__ from sequential cleavage of APP by beta and gamma secretase.  
 Initiating the A-beta processing system as well as showing an increased level in patients, BACE1 __plays a central role__ in AD pathogenesis.

 The APOE-epsilon4 carriers were __over-represented__ in Braak V-VI group.  
 Increased MS4A6A expression in our neuropathologic cohort is __in line with__ previous findings, which have reported higher plasma levels of MS4A6A in AD patients than in controls or subjects with mild cognitive impairments.

 We __note__ an __over-representation of__ T cell-specific eQTLs among susceptibility alleles for autoimmune diseases and __of__ monocyte-specific eQTLs among Alzheimer's and Parkinson's desease variants.   
 This polarization __implicates specific immune cell types in__ these diseases and __points to__ the need to identify the __cell-autonomous effects__ of disease susceptibility variants.   
 Because most disease-associated variants localize to noncoding regions of the genome, __an initial role__ of their function can be __inferred__ from their __proximity to a gene__ and association to gene expression levels or to epigenomic features derived from representative tissues and cell types.  
 __Given the centrol role of__ inflammation in many diseases, we laveraged differences in the genetic structure of human populations to __systematically interogate__ the role of peripherial blood cell types that __represent__ the lymphoid(CD4 plus T lymphocyte) and myeloid(CD14 plus CD16 minus monocyte) __arms__ of the immune system.
